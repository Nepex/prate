                    To begin searching for a match, simply click 'FIND A MATCH'. Prate will open a matching dialog and
                    begin looking for your match. The matching works by looking
                    through your selected interests and finding other users with the same interests. If no other users
                    have been found matching your interests, then you will be matched
                    with the first available person.

                    X icon will log you out and return you to the home page. Clicking the Prate icon
                    at any time will also return you to the home page without logging you out. On mobile these will just
                    be named links inside a dropdown after tapping your user avatar.

                    &lt;h1&gt;This will be large text&lt;/h1&gt;. Currently supported tags include: H1-6, I, B, U, and
                    Strong. Any malicious code or fake links will
                    be striped from your message.

                    link to the URL for you. To show an image, paste in the link to the image (jpg, gif, png) and a preview will appear in
